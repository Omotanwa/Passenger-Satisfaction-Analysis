Analysis 

Step 1: Firstly, exploratory data analysis was performed on data to check if there is no outlier, missing values and also check if the right data type was used in each column. The result of EDA showed that there are no outliers and missing data as a result the data was good for analysis.


Step 2: Afterwards, the data analysis was done in excel using pivot charts and dashboard was built. 

Result: From the analysis it can be deduced that passengers in the business class showed a higher level of satisfaction during long flight hours as compared to the remaining classes. It can be assumed that the higher and better services offered to the business class passengers positively impacted the satisfaction level. However, the economy and economy plus showed a higher level of dissatisfaction. Hence, it can be concluded that flight distance is impacted by satisfaction level.

Also, Baggage handling and inflight services contributes most to customer satisfaction while inflight WIFI and ease of online booking were the least contributing factors to passengers satisfaction.
